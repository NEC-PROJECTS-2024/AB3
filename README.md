INTRODUCTION

liver is the largest gland in the human body, performs over 500 vital functions such as producing serum proteins, detoxifying blood, and storing essential vitamins. Liver diseases, common between ages 40-60 and more prevalent in men, pose significant health risks and contribute to high mortality rates globally. Early detection using machine learning (ML) algorithms on extensive datasets like the Indian Liver Patient Dataset has revolutionized healthcare, improving prediction accuracy and treatment outcomes. Conditions like fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, and cirrhosis necessitate prompt diagnosis through tests like Liver Function Tests (LFTs) to enable timely interventions and lifestyle modifications, crucial for managing liver diseases effectively and improving patient survival rates. The study evaluated various ML models, highlighting the importance of data preprocessing, outlier removal, and algorithm selection in enhancing prediction accuracy and clinical decision-making for liver disease management.
